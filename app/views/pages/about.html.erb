          <p class="about-description">In high school, I was that kid that seemed to never be paying attention. Seemingly in my own world but with to much energy. Even when I focused to class I used and I still do flood the teacher with my own questions. Coding and logic help me focus the flow, but this path is along and arduous path that can only be runned with passion for what I am doing</p>
          <p class="about-description">I thought that is enough with having the talent and that I donÂ´t need to much order, but this is an error that coding taught me. After this lesson now I my mind now is structurated but still preservs parts of its rebel soul.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="services-description">HACCP stands for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point. A food safety management system based on the principles of HACCP is a systematic approach to identifying and controlling hazards, whether microbiological, chemical or physical, that could pose a threat to the production of safe food â€“ in simple terms, it involves identifying what could go wrong in a food system and planning how to prevent it.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="services-description">The kitchen is a hotspot for bacteria and parasites. This is why good kitchen hygiene during both food preparation and cooking are extremely critical in terms of preventing food borne illnesses.Bacteria may sit on kitchen counters, stick to your raw meats, and end up contaminating all those delicious foods. These being germs, they are for the most part completely invisible.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="services-description">Germs can very quickly and easily spread between our hands into the food, so keeping clean hands before initiating in any food handling process is essential. Washing hands properly when you are going to touch raw meat, especially after visiting the toilet or using the kitchen bin significantly helps in reducing the spread of several types of harmful bacteria like salmonella and E. coli.</p>

              <h3 class="services-title-2">Proper Food Storage</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="services-description">Correct food storage is as critical as correct cooking. When storing cooked food in your fridge or cooler ensure it is at room temperature or even lower. Placing warm food inside a fridge implies it has not cooled evenly and could as such, cause food poisoning.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="services-description">After cooking, keeping a clean kitchen is very important. It is estimated that the average kitchen chopping board carries more faecal bacteria compared to the average toilet seat. Never keep cooked food in your refrigerator for more than 7 days.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="services-description">Always use individual or separate cutting boards for different food ingredients like fish/raw meat/poultry, farm produce, and cooked foods. Using a common chopping/cutting board poses a health risk, but these can be prevented easily through maintaining a clean kitchen at all times. You may, for example, opt to have a distinct red cutting board to be used specifically only for raw animal foods so as to avert any cross contamination.</p>
